Part 1: Archibald's Athenaeum: A UI/UX Style Guide
Core Philosophy
This is not a "web app." This is the digital manifestation of a private library or a members-only club in Mayfair. The design must exude understated luxury, analogue warmth, and digital precision. Every element should feel considered, expensive, and timeless. The user is not a "user"; they are a "visitor" in Archibald's personal study. The UI must be an extension of his personality: ordered, sophisticated, and deeply knowledgeable.

Color Palette
The palette is drawn from the world of whisky, aged leather, and old books. It is warm, rich, and has high contrast for readability without being stark.

Primary Background (Peat Smoke): A deep, very dark, warm gray. Not pure black.

Tailwind: bg-gray-900 / bg-[#1a1a18]

Card & Sidebar Background (Aged Oak): A slightly lighter, rich warm gray for primary content containers.

Tailwind: bg-gray-800 / bg-[#2c2c2a]

Primary Accent (Amber Dram): A vibrant, warm amber-orange. Used for primary buttons, active states, focus rings, and key highlights.

Tailwind: bg-amber-600, text-amber-500, border-amber-600

Primary Text (Parchment): A soft, slightly off-white.

Tailwind: text-gray-200

Secondary Text & Borders (Limestone): A subtle, light gray for placeholder text, metadata, inactive icons, and card borders.

Tailwind: text-gray-500, border-gray-700

Utility - Success (Verdant): A muted, deep green.

Tailwind: text-green-400

Utility - Error (Crimson): A desaturated, deep red.

Tailwind: text-red-400

Typography
Headings (Archibald's Voice): A classic, elegant serif font.

Font: Lora (from Google Fonts).

Body & UI Text (The Conversation): A clean, highly readable sans-serif font.

Font: Inter (from Google Fonts).

Component Styling
Layout: A two-column layout. A primary chat area on the right, and a narrower, fixed sidebar on the left.

Cards & Modals: Use Aged Oak backgrounds with a subtle Limestone border. rounded-lg provides a modern, soft corner.

Buttons:

Primary: Solid Amber Dram background, Parchment text. Glows slightly on hover.

Secondary: Outlined with a Limestone border, Parchment text. Border color changes to Amber Dram on hover.

Chat Bubbles: User messages use a darker background (bg-gray-700). Archibald's messages use the standard Aged Oak (bg-gray-800) and feature a subtle Amber Dram left border to signify authority.

Iconography
Library: Lucide Icons (lucide.dev).

Style: Thin, line-art icons in Limestone. They turn to Parchment or Amber Dram on hover/active states.
